# CS 300: CourseInfo Program - Design and Development 

          What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This project is designed to create a useful tool for academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABC University. 
It manages course information by storing the data in a hash table. 
The program provides a menu of functions for: 


 - Load Data Structure  - LOADS DATA INTO HASH TABLE FROM FILE
  
 - Print Course List  - PRINT LIST OF COURSE CODES, TITLES, AND PREREQUISITES
   
 - Print Course  - INPUT COURSE CODE FROM USER TO OUTPUT COURSE INFORMATION
   
 - Enter File Name  - ALLOWS USER TO ENTER A FILE NAME TO THEN BE LOADED

 - Exit



          How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

 - The approach was to use appropriate data structures, namely a hash table (implemented by using an unordered_map in C++) and a vector, to organize the data. 

 - By completing a thorough analysis of the data structures, I was able to determine the best option for handling the data in this case was a hash table. The hash table allowed efficient and fast access to course details, making it convenient for retrieving specific information. Furthermore, I utilized a vector data structure to maintain the order of the data. By combining the hash table and vector, I achieved a balance between quick access and preserving the desired order of the elements.

By carefully considering the characteristics and requirements of the data, I made an informed decision to select the hash table as the primary data structure for this assignment.  This ensured efficient data retrieval while maintaining the desired order.


          How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Whenever I faced roadblocks I enacted the following strategies:

 - I would go over the supplied requirements and documentation.

 - Refer back to my pseudocode to get an idea of where I may have errors in my code or work.

 - Research online for alternate ways to solve the problem.

 - Take notes on different aspects that could help me solve the problem.

 - Create multiple other copies of my code for testing and editing.

 - ake short breaks for mental recollection and to think over some of my roadblocks.



          How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

 - The projects in this course have highlighted the significance of meticulous software design and the efficient utilization of data structures. Over the duration of the course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in employing, manipulating, and interpreting various data structures, while also understanding their runtime characteristics. The course equipped me with a many strategies for crafting effective pseudocode, thoroughly analyzing data structures, and selecting the most appropriate one for a given task.  By emphasizing the importance of a well-planned software design and the effective use of data structures, this course has equipped me with the necessary tools and insights that I will be able to apply to future projects.



          How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

 - These projects have helped me produce more detailed pseudocode. They have provided valuable opportunities to learn and apply essential skills, including the implementation and utilization of diverse data structures to achieve similar outcomes or goals. Thanks to the assignments and projects in this course, the organization and readability of my pseudocode and code has improved.   This will allow me to produce work that is a lot more adaptable and maintainable for future adaptations and updates.   
        


Whenever I faced roadblocks I enacted the following strategies:

Reviewed the provided requirments and documentation of the assignment. This helped me regain clarity and ensured that I was on the right track.

Consulted my pseudocode to help identify potential errors in my code or work. This provided valuable insight for troubleshooting.

Researched and explored online for approaches and solutions to the problems I was facing. This helped me broaden my perspective and learn new strategies.

Took notes on different aspects or insights that could aide me in solving the problem.

Created multiple other copies of my code for testing and editing. This allowed me to test and experiment different modifications without the fear of losing progress.

Took periodic breaks for mental recollection and allowed me to approach roadblocks with a fresh perspective.

By implementing these strategies, I was able to overcome obstacles and find effective solutions to the problems I encountered.
