# CS_300_Project_2

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

This project is designed to create a useful tool for academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABC University. 
It manages course information by storing the data in a hash table. 
The program provides a menu of functions for: 


•	Load Data Structure  - LOADS DATA INTO HASH TABLE FROM FILE
  
•	Print Course List  - PRINT LIST OF COURSE CODES, TITLES, AND PREREQUISITES
   
•	Print Course  - INPUT COURSE CODE FROM USER TO OUTPUT COURSE INFORMATION
   
•	Enter File Name  - ALLOWS USER TO ENTER A FILE NAME TO THEN BE LOADE

•	Exit

        ==========================================================

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

o	The approach was to use appropriate data structures, namely a hash table (implemented using an unordered_map in C++) and a vector, to organize the data. 
o	Doing the analysis to understand the difference in the data structures help me choose the right one for handling the data. Overall the hash table made the most sense for this assignment. A hash table makes it easy to quickly access course details, and the vector helps maintain order.

        ==========================================================

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Whenever i faced roadblocks i enacted the following strategies:

•	I would go over the supplied  requirements and documentation.

•	Refer back to my pseudocode to get an idea of where I may have errors in my code or work.

•	Research online for alternate ways to solve the problem.

•	Take notes on different aspects that could help me solve the problem.

•	Create multiple other copies of my code for testing and editing.

•	Take short breaks for mental recollection and to think over some of my roadblocks.

        ==========================================================

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

o	These projects in this course highlight the importance of well-planned software design and the effective use of data structures.

o	Through this course I have learned how to use, manipulate, and interpret different data structures and how to determine their runtimes. I have learned many different strategies for writing pseudocode, analyzing data structures, and how to implement the right one for a specific task at hand.

        ==========================================================

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

o	These projects have helped me become more detailed in my pseudocode. They have also taught me necessary skills such as how to implement and make use of different data structures to achieve the same goal. My pseudocode and code have also become more readable and organized due to the assignments and projects. Overall, this in turn makes my work a lot more adaptable and maintainable for future adaptations and updates.
